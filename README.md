# Web-Site-Facul-Beer-
Another web site made with CSS,HTML and JavaScript. I design created this site for a funny idea in a mix of facul and beer and I just programed a stopwatch, when gets zero change the page information. In the future I want to create a page to register new clients and purchase, but for who wants to sharp his skills with this and improve my work make yourself, one detail it's in portuguese.

TO USE After you made the download and unpack and open the file, just unpack also the folder 'conteudo' and you can open the Html and see my work without any problem.

To set the stopwatch, you go to Java Script and modifie the two lets, such seconds and minuts.
